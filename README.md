Spooky is a free web framework. It follows the view-style-server (VSS) design pattern. It offers a structure that allows you to develop quickly and intuitively. 
Spooky contains a strong and a large library with a collection of tools useful to the creation of the design (graphics, animation and interactions with the page in the browser ... etc. ...) sites and web applications.
